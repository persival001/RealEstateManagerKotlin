# Real Estate Manager
## Introduction
This Android application is designed to help real estate agencies and agents modernize their workflow by digitizing their property management. With its rich set of features, agents can manage properties with ease, from anywhere at any time.

## Features
Property Management
Property Details: Store comprehensive information about properties, including type, price, size, room count, full description, photos, address, nearby points of interest, and property status.
Offline Support: Thanks to local SQLite database storage and ContentProvider for data access, the app can fully function without an internet connection.
Property Status: Keep track of the property status, whether it's available or sold, with mandatory sale dates for sold properties.
Property Creation: Add new properties directly from the app with notifications upon successful addition.
Property Edition: Update existing property information whenever required.
Advanced Functionalities
Geo-localization: If the agent is connected and locatable, they can display properties on a map to identify those nearest to them.
Search Engine: Perform multi-criteria searches across all properties in the database.
Complementary Features: Implement a chosen complementary feature, such as a loan simulator, video integration, or Firebase backend synchronization.
